## Review

Serious book written in the funny style. Russell Brand basically shares with us things he believes in, mostly concerning how the modern world should look like and how we can get there.

His book is a good account of meaningful quotes and their simple interpretations of wise people of our time and from the past. But it is also an account of ideas and implementation policies that are available right now. He collected those ideas from different spheres of life - politics, economy, ecology, culture, religion - and presented them in easy to grasp form.

What this book does is show us that better future is possible and that so many people working on it and believe in it and that it will happen soon.

## Notes

> What I believe is that we're only just beginning to understand the incredible capacity of human beings, that we can become something unrecognizable, that we can have true freedom, not some tantalizing emblem forever out of reach. Not weary compromise and nagging fear.

&nbsp;

> More important, perhaps, that this galling inequality is the fact that we have limited amount of time to resolve it.

&nbsp;

> James Lovelock, the block who came up with Gaia theory, that the earth is one symbiotic, interrelated organism where harmonious life forms support or regulate each other, says we shouldn't bother with recycling, wind turbines, and Priuses.

&nbsp;

> Since Friedrich Nietzsche (deceased) declared, "God is dead", we've been exploring the observation of British writer G.K. Chesterton, who said, "The death of God doesn't mean man will believe in nothing but that he will believe in anything".

&nbsp;

> Adam Curtis in his revolutionary documentary series The Century of the Self delineated expertly how theories of Sigmund Freud were deployed by his nephew Edward Bernays to create the profession of PR and generate consumer boom of fifties... The small but seismic interjection that Bernays ... enacted was this: "Buy these shoes, they'll make you feel sexy"... What Bernays established was the connection between consuming a product and feeling better.

&nbsp;

> We have been told that freedom is the ability to pursue our petty, trivial desires when true freedom is freedom from these petty, trivial desires.

&nbsp;

> Joseph Campbell said all the problems that we are experiencing - economic disparity, ecological meltdown, crime, alienation, atomization, war, starvation - are the result of us having no communal myth. A story that unites us, defines us, in relationship to ourselves, other people, and nature. Campbell says the myths that we have are antiquated and irrelevant "dessert myths".

&nbsp;

> Without codes that empathize our unity and the presence of a sacred consciousness, it seems that we become dominated by materialism and individualism.

&nbsp;

> Campbell said, "All religions are true in that the metaphor is true". I think he means that religions are meant to be literary maps, not literal doctrines, a signpost to the unknowable, a hymn to the inconceivable.

&nbsp;

> Science requires faith, the way religion does. Science requires acceptance of metaphor,, juts the way religion does.

&nbsp;

> If you picture the Milky Way as being the size of mainland Europe, our solar system - that's Mars, Venus, Saturn, us here on Earth ... - in a Milky Way the size of Europe our solar system would fit inside a single teacup somewhere in Belgium.

&nbsp;

> A person experiences life as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. Our task must be to free ourselves from this self-imposed prison, and through compassions, to find the reality of Oneness. (AP: Einstein)

&nbsp;

> Prejudice is a permutation of some psychological fear.

Ideas for change by Helena Norberg-Hodge:

1) Rein in the power of big business by renegotiating trade treaties to insist that multinational corporations be place-based and accountable to nation states; revoking the charters of any corporation with revenue larger that the smallest nation GNP; scrapping the WTO and creating WEO (World Environment Organization); controlling the private funding of political campaigns.

2) Re-localize food and farming by taxing food miles; removing subsidies and research for large-scale, capital and energy-intensive agriculture; giving support to small, diversified organic production and to the growing number of young people who want to take up farming.

3) Prioritize life over profit by rejecting GNP in favor of indicators that measure biodiversity, community coherence, personal well-being, and other life-affirming criteria; radically reducing public spending on "defense"; granting legal rights to ecosystems and nonhuman species; rewriting educational curricula to meet community and environmental needs rather than the needs of industry.

Other ideas:

- debt cancelation

- no more private security for the wealthy and powerful

- get rid of all titles

> The dividing line between good and evil cuts through every human heart. (AP: Solzhenitsyn)

&nbsp;

> If space is limitless ... then the difference in size between and electron and atom, a golf ball, a football, the moon, the Earth, Jupiter, is all irrelevant, because the context has no limit.

&nbsp;

> You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him on quarter of a million miles and say, "Look at that, you son of a bitch". (AP: Edgar D. Mitchell)

&nbsp;

> The aim is to reach the point where I can fully contain the drama, where my defective conduct doesn't leak out into other people's life.

&nbsp;

> We need to establish a few immutable, nonnegotiable principles, mostly to respect the planet and individual freedom, then look at who is benefitting from things being the way they are now, and using no violence when we approach them and no titles when we address them, politely insist they give us our plant back.

> The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country. (AP: GÃ¶ring)
