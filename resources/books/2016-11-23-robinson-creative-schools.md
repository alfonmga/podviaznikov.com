## Review

Reading this book I deeply felt that it is not about the revolution in education. It's a book about any complex adaptive human system. It's a book about how to *change* such systems. We live in the age when it's easy to see that a lot of systems surrounding us are broken in some ways and often do more harm than good. We see that such systems need change.

Broken systems vary depending on the country you live in but quite often they include not only education but health care, media, government, judiciary etc.

It's a nice to have a framework how to think about systems and change. How to see problems with existing ones, how to came up (or find) with better ideas for the future and how to introduce changes in the different levels.

## Notes

> Civilization is a race between education and catastrophe. (AP: H.G. Wells)

&nbsp;

> If you design a system to do something specific, don't be surprised if it does it. If you run an education system based on standardization and conformity that suppresses individuality, imagination, and creativity, don't be surprised if that's what it does.

&nbsp;

> You can be part of the change. To do that, you need three forms of understanding: a *critique* of the way things are, a *vision* of how they should be, and a *theory of change* for how to move from one to another.

&nbsp;

> Aims of education are *to enable students to understand the world around them and the talents within them so that they can become fulfilled individuals and active, compassionate citizens*.

&nbsp;

> If everyone consumed at the same rate as the average person in North America, we're told the planet could sustain a maximum population of 1.5 billion

&nbsp;

> We are divided as ever by cultural differences and by economic competition for the same resources.

&nbsp;

> Although education is now a global issue, it is inevitably a grassroots process.

&nbsp;

> In 2008, IBM published a survey of what characteristics organization leaders need most in their staff... The two priorities were *adaptability to change* and *creativity in generating new ideas*.

&nbsp;

> 'Shanghai does not need so-called # 1 schools', he (AP: Yi Houqin) said. 'What it needs are schools that follow sound educational principles, respect principles of students' physical  and psychological development, and lay a solid foundation for students lifelong development'

&nbsp;

> Research and practical experience show time and again that the critical factors in raising student achievement on all fronts are the motivation and expectations of students themselves. The best ways to raise them are to improve the quality of teaching, have a rich and balanced curriculum, and have supportive, informative systems of assessment.

&nbsp;

> People do not come in standard sizes or shapes, not do their abilities and personalities.

&nbsp;

> Industrial process demand *compliance* with specific rules and standards.

&nbsp;

> Industrial processes are *linear*.

&nbsp;

> Industrial production is related to *market demands*.

&nbsp;

> As in typical factories, high schools and higher education in particular are organized around the *division of labor*.

&nbsp;

> Educating children by age group assumes that the most important thing they have in common is their date of manufacture... We don't apply this batching principle outside of schools. We don't keep all the ten-tear-olds away from the nine-year-olds, in the separate facilities.

&nbsp;

> Life itself is not linear... The lives we create are the results of all sorts of currents and crosscurrents, most of which we can't anticipate in advance.

&nbsp;

> Most Industrial processes generate huge amounts of waste and low-value by-products. So does education.

&nbsp;

> Industrial processes can create catastrophic problems in the environment... Economist describe these as "externalities".

&nbsp;

> If you think of education as mechanistic process that's just not working as well as it used to, it's easy to make false assumptions about how it can be fixed; that if it can just be tweaked and standardized in the right way it will work efficiently in perpetuity. That fact is that it won't, because it's not that sort of process at all, however much some politicians would like it to be.

&nbsp;

> Education is not an industrial process at all; it is an organic one.

&nbsp;

> Products, from screws to airplanes, have no opinions or feelings about how they are produced or what happens to them. People. do. They have motivations, feelings, circumstances, and talents.

&nbsp;

> The proper analogy for industrial education is industrial farming.

&nbsp;

Four principles of education we need to cultivate:

- **Health**. Organic education promotes the development and well-being of the whole student, intellectually, physically, spiritually, and socially.

- **Ecology**. Organic education recognizes the vital interdependence of all of these aspects of development, within each student and the community as a whole.

- **Fairness**. Organic education cultivates the individual talents and potential of all students, whatever their circumstances, and respects the roles ad responsibilities of those who work with them.

- **Care**. Organic education creates optimum conditions for students' development, based on compassion, experience, and practical wisdom.

Four basic purposes of education: economic, cultural, social, and personal.

&nbsp;

> Education should enable students to become economically responsible and independent.

&nbsp;

> Education should enable students to understand and appreciate their own cultures and to respect the diversity of others.

&nbsp;

> As humanity becomes more numerous and interwoven, living respectfully within diversity is not just ethical choice, it is a practical imperative.

&nbsp;

> Education should enable young people to engage with the world within them as well as the world around them.

&nbsp;

> The heart of education is the relationship between the student and the teacher. Everything else depends on how productive and successful that relationship is.

&nbsp;

> There is the world that exists whether or not you exist: the world of other people., of material objects and events. There is also a world that exists only because you exist: the world of your private consciousness. One of the challenges of being alive is making sense of both of these worlds and of relationships between them.

&nbsp;

> (AP: Howard Gardner) identifies eight modes of intelligence and suggests that we all have a unique blend of all of them.

&nbsp;

> Children in these (AP: hunter-gatherer) cultures were allowed to play without adult guidance all day. The adults considered play essential to learning skills that lead to becoming responsible grown-ups.

&nbsp;

> Children "are designed, by nature, to play and explore on their own, independently of adults. They need freedom in order to develop; without it they suffer. The drive to play freely is a basic, biological drive".

&nbsp;

> Free play is the means by which children learn to make friends, overcome their fears, solve their own problems, and generally take control of their own lives. It is also the primary means by which children practice and acquire the physical and intellectual skills that are essential for successes in the culture in which they are growing... The things that children learn through their own initiatives, in free play, cannot be taught in other ways.

&nbsp;

> Creative work in any domain involves increasing control of the knowledge, concepts, and practices that have shaped that domain and a deepening understanding of the traditions and achievements in which it is based.

&nbsp;

> The key to raising achievement is to recognize that teaching and learning is a relationship. Students need teachers who connect with them. And above all, they need teachers who believe in them.

&nbsp;

> "Human being should not be passive. When they get together, they should be interacting with each other. They should be solving problems, or they should be making things."

&nbsp;

> Creativity is the process of having original ideas that have values.

&nbsp;

> Imagination is the root of creativity. It is the ability to bring to mind things that aren't present to our senses. Creativity is putting your imagination to work. It is applied imagination. Innovation is putting new ideas into practice.

&nbsp;

> (AP: Creative work) is a dynamic process that often involves making new connections, crossing disciplines, and using metaphors and analogies.

&nbsp;

Teachers can fulfill three essential purposes for students:

 - inspiration

 - confidence

 - creativity

 8 competencies relevant to all four purposes:

 - curiosity - the ability to ask questions and explore how the world works.

 - creativity - the ability to generate new ideas and apply them in practice.

 - criticism - the ability to analyze information and ideas and to form reasoned arguments and judgements.

&nbsp;

> The ability to think clearly, to consider arguments logically, and to weigh evidence dispassionately is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence...
Critical thinking involves more than formal logic. It involves interpreting what's needed, understanding the context, fathoming hidden values and feelings, discerning motives, detecting bias, and presenting concise conclusions in the most appropriate forms...
The need has never been greater ... to separate fact from opinion, sense from nonsense, and honesty from deception... Critical thinking should be at the heart of every discipline in school and cultivated habit outside it too.

 - communication - the ability to express though and feelings clearly and confidently in a range of media and forms.

 - collaboration - the ability to work constructively with others.

&nbsp;

> In many schools, young people largely work on their own; they learn *in* group but not *as* groups.

&nbsp;

> Enabling young people ti work together can enhance self-esteem, stimulate curiosity, heighten social behavior. Through group work, students can learn to cooperate with others in solving problems and meeting common goals, to draw on each other's strength and mitigate weaknesses, and to share and develop ideas. They can learn to negotiate, to resolve conflicts, and to support agreed solutions.

 - compassion - the ability to empathize with others and to act accordingly.

 &nbsp;

 > Compassion is identifying with with the feelings of others and especially with their suffering. Compassion is rooted in empathy. It begins by recognizing in ourselves the emotions that others are feeling and how we would feel in the same circumstances...
 Many of the problems that young people face are rooted in lack of compassion. Bullying, violence, emotional abuse, social exclusion, and prejudices based on ethnicity, culture, or sexuality are all fueled by failures of empathy. In the wider adult world, cultural conflicts and toxic social divisions are ignited and inflamed by these failures too.
 As the world becomes more interdependent, cultivating compassion is a moral and a practical imperative. It is also a spiritual one. Practicing compassion is the truest expression of our common humanity and deep source of happiness in ourselves and others.


 - composure - the ability to connect with the inner life of feeling and develop sense of personal harmony and balance.

&nbsp;

> Many young people now suffer from stress, anxiety, and depression in school... These feelings can lead to boredom, disengagement, anger, and worse... (AP: Schools) can also give students the time and techniques to explore their inner worlds through that daily practice of meditation.

 - citizenship - the ability to engage constructively with society and to participate in the process that sustain it.

&nbsp;

> Citizenship education is not about promoting conformity and status quo. It is about championing the need for equal rights, the value of dissent, and the need to balance personal freedoms with the rights of others to live in peace.
The skills of citizenship need to be learned and practiced. They also need to be continually renewed. This may be what John Dewey had in mind when he said, "Democracy has to be born every generation, and education is its midwife".

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

> (AP: Sport games) provide important opportunities to develop individual and team skills and to share success and failure in controlled environments.

&nbsp;

> Effective learners will be happy and successful in life because they are self-dependent and can adapt to demanding situations - they will know what to do when they don't know what to do.

&nbsp;

> I've been told that some parents ask for their children to be diagnosed with attention problems and to be medicated, because the diagnosis allows the children to be given more time to complete the tests. For some people at least, ADHD has become strategic condition.

&nbsp;

> "The world economy no longer pays you for what you know; Google knows everything. The world economy pays you for what you can do with what you know...
We see a rapid decline in the demand for routine cognitive skills in our world and the kinds of things that are easy to test and easy to teach are also the kinds of things that are easy to digitize, automate, and outsource" (AP: Andreas Schlecher)

&nbsp;

> "Not everything important is measurable and not everything measurable is important" (AP: Eliot Eisner)

&nbsp;

> (AP: Myra Barrs and Hillary Hester) became convinced that they could use what is really an empirical model - what you would use if you wanted to study change in any adaptive system. First, you take a snapshot of the system at the beginning, and then you observer over time and you gather samples of work, and then do your analysis.

&nbsp;

> The United States has chosen to standardize testing and accountability, and the results have been underwhelming. Finland has chosen to standardize the way they prepare teachers rather then tests, and the Finnish educational system is lauded around the world.

&nbsp;

> Change is often the result of many complex forces interacting with each other.

&nbsp;

> "When children aren't given the space to struggle through things on their own, they don't learn to problem-solve very well They don't learn to be confident in their own abilities, and it can affect their self-esteem. The other problem with never having to struggle is that you never experience failure and can develop an overwhelming fear of failure and of disappointing others. Both the low self-confidence and the fear of failure can lead to depression or anxiety." (AP: Chris Meno)

&nbsp;

> People will achieve miracles if they are motivated by a driving vision and sense of purpose. That vision has to connect with them personally.

&nbsp;

> The system that sets people against each other fundamentally misunderstands the dynamics that drive achievement. Education thrives on partnership and collaboration - within schools, between schools, and with other groups and organizations.

&nbsp;

> One of the most powerful strategies for systemic change is to test the benefits of doing things differently. Innovation is strategic when it has significance beyond its immediate context - when it inspires others to innovate i similar ways in their own situations.

&nbsp;

> Culture is a set of permissions about what is and what is not acceptable behavior.

&nbsp;

> No amount of debate on strategy will result in consensus if the purposes we have in mind are opposed.

&nbsp;

Vision + Skills + Incentives + Resources + Action Plan = Change

No Vision = Confusion

No Skills = Anxiety

No Incentives = Resistance

No Resources = Frustration

No Action Plan = Diffusion

&nbsp;

> When enough people move, that is a movement. And if movement has enough energy, that is a revolution.

&nbsp;

> Advocates and practitioners of personalized and holistic education come from many cultures and perspectives. They include Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, John Dewey, Michael Duane, Kurt Hahn, Jiddu Krishnamurtu, Dorothy Heathcote, Jean Piaget, Maria Montessori, Sir Alec Clegg, Noam Chomsky, and many more.
