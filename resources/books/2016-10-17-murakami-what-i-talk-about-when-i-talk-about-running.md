Very personal memoir by Haruki Murakami that covers 30 something years of his life: after he became a writer and started to run.

Few interesting things that I noticed:

  - Murakami shows his personal struggles with getting older. Aging is such an important topic that touches everyone, however it's not talked often about. Seeing your result getting worth with an age is a good way to be aware of time in life. It keeps you focused on important thing and helps you appreciate life
  - I really appreciated how he put length of human life in a better perspective. He became a writer after being 33 years old. He sold his bar, quit smoking, changed his diet, started writing and running. His best pat of the life where he was true to himself started in the mid-30s.
  - Murakami emphasizes how for him life is process of knowing himself better. Knowing what he likes, what is important for him. How he focuses on internal matters not external things. He decides to spent as much time with people he like and avoid people he dislikes. He is not competitive because for him competitiveness is about looking outwards not inward.
  - Another important lesson: everything worthy in life requires big effort. He shows how setting up routine and rules for himself is paramount.


> Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional

&nbsp;

> No matter how mundane some action might appear, keep at it long enough and it becomes a contemplative, even meditative act

&nbsp;

> I stop everyday right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day's work goes surprisingly smoothly. I think Ernest Hemingway did something like that. To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is important thing for long-term project.

&nbsp;

> Beating somebody else just does't do it for me. I'm much more interested in whether I reach the goals that I set for myself.

&nbsp;

> Writer has a quiet, inner motivation, and doesn't seek validation in the outwardly visible.

&nbsp;

> But just as our consciousness is a maze, so too is our body. Everywhere you turn there is darkness and a blind spot. Everywhere you find silent hints, everywhere a surprise is waiting for you.

&nbsp;

> I'm stuck by how, except when you are young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don't get that sort of system set by a certain age, you'll lack focus, and your life will be out of balance.

&nbsp;

> The most important thing we ever learn at school is the fact that the most important things can't be learned at school.

&nbsp;

> I don't think we should judge the values of our lives by how efficient they are.

&nbsp;

> Muscles are hard to get and easy to lose. Fat is easy to get and hard to lose.

&nbsp;

> Nothing in the real world is as beautiful as the illusions of a person about to lose consciousness.

&nbsp;

> If you are going to while away the years, it's far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog.

&nbsp;

> Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits - that's a metaphor for life.

&nbsp;

> As you age you learn even to be happy with what you have. That's one of the few good points of growing older.

&nbsp;

> It doesn't matter how old I got, but as long as I continue to live I'll always discover something new about myself.

&nbsp;

> It's precisely because of the pain, precisely because we want to overcome that pain, that we can get the feeling, through this process, of really being *alive* - or at least a partial sense of it. Your quality of experience is based not on standards such as time and ranking, but on finally awakening to an awareness of the fluidity within action itself.

&nbsp;

> To be able to grasp something of value, sometimes you have to perform seemingly inefficient acts.
