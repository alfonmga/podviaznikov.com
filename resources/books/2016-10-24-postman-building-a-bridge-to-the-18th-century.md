**Introduction**

> Imagined futures are always more about where we have been than where we are going.

**A Bridge to the 18th century**

&nbsp;

> To forget our mistakes is bad. But to forget our successes may be worth.

&nbsp;

> When people do not have a satisfactory narrative to generate a sense of purpose and continuity,
a kind of psychic disorientation takes hold, followed by a frantic search for something to believe in or,
probably worse, a resigned conclusion that there is nothing to find.

&nbsp;

> I write for those who are still searching for a way to confront the future, a way that
faces reality as it is, that is connected to a humane tradition, that provides sane authority and
meaningful purpose...
Where should we look for such a way? Well, of course, one turns first to the wisdom of the sages, both near and far. Marcus Aurelius said, "At every action, no matter by whom preferred, make it a practice to ask yourself, 'What is his object in doing this?' But begin with yourself; out this question to yourself first of all." Goethe told us, "One should, each day, try to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few reasonable words." Socrates said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Rabbi Hillel said, "What is hateful to thee, do not do to another." The prophet Micah: "What does Lord require of thee but do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with The God." And our own Henry David Thoreau said, "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end."

&nbsp;

> Marvin Minsky and others working in the field of artificial intelligence have prophesied enthusiastically that humans will become merely pets of their computers

&nbsp;

> I am suspicious of people who want us to be forward-looking. I literally do not know what they mean when they say, "We must look ahead to see where we are going". What is it that they wish us to look at? There is nothing yet to see in the future. If looking ahead means anything, it must mean finding in our past useful and humane ideas with which to fill the future.

&nbsp;

> What is there (AP: XX century) to find - the principle of indeterminacy? Nietzsche's arguments for the death of God? Freud's insistence that reason is merely a servant of the genitalia? The idea that language is utterly incapable of providing accurate maps of reality?

&nbsp;

> Among their (AP: ancient greeks) values none stood higher than that in all things one should strive for excellence.

&nbsp;

> "Every culture", Lewis Mumford once wrote, "lives within its dream.". But we often lose our dream, as I believe happened to us in the twentieth century. And we are in danger if we cannot reclaim one that will help us to go forward. What else is history for if not to remind us about our better dreams?

&nbsp;

> Let us not turn to the eighteenth century in order to copy the institutions she fashioned for herself but in order that we may better understand what suits us. Let us look there for instructions rather than models. Let us adopt principles rather than details.

**Progress**

&nbsp;

> Bacon is the first to claim that the principle end of scientific work was t advance the "happiness of mankind". He continually criticized his predecessors for failing to understand that the real, legitimate, and only goal of the sciences is the "endowment of human life with new inventions and riches"

&nbsp;

> Both David Hume and Adam Smith argued that there existed a self-generating impulse of rising expectations that must lead to a society of continuous improvement.

&nbsp;

> Bernard Mandeville argued that the "private vices" of envy and pride are, in fact, "public virtues" in that they stimulate industry and invention, and Hume wrote that the "pleasure of luxury and the profit of commerce roused men from their indolence", leading them to advances in their various enterprises.

&nbsp;

> "In Defense of Poetry", he (AP: Perry Shelley) made the arguments that explained why Reason itself was insufficient to produce humane progress. Indeed, when science and technology claim to provide ethical imperatives, we are lead into moral catastrophe...
It is only through love, tenderness, and beauty, he wrote, that the mind is made receptive to the moral decency, and poetry is the means by which love, tenderness, and beat are best cultivated. It is the poetic imagination, not scientific accomplishment, that is the engine of moral progress... Thus, the "heaven city" that the eighteenth-century  rationalists dreamed of is not reachable through reason alone...
Progress is the business of the heart , bit the intellect.

&nbsp;

> The idea of progress, then, is one of the great gifts of the Enlightenment. The eighteenth century invented it, elaborated it, and promoted it, and in doing so generated vast resources of vitality, confidence, and hope. But the eighteenth century also criticized and doubted it, initiating powerful arguments about its limitations and pitfalls.


**Technology**

&nbsp;

> Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola, documented in their novels the spiritual emptiness that a culture obsessed with progress produces.

&nbsp;

> For all of the Twain's enthusiasm for the giantism of American industry, the totality of his work is an affirmation of the pre-technological values. Personal loyalty, regional tradition, the continuity of family life, the relevance of the tales and wisdom of the elderly, are the soul of his books.

&nbsp;

> It seemed clear to many in the nineteenth century that progress was as real as gravity or any other natural phenomenon. And its reality was given special force by the great invention of invention. We learned *how* to invent things, and the question of *why* receded in importance.The idea that if something could be done, it should be done was born in the nineteenth century. And along with it there developed a profound belief in all the principles through which invention succeeds: objectivity, efficiency, standartization, measurement, a market economy, and, of course, faith in progress.

&nbsp;

> But something had happened, as we know, in the twentieth century. Among other things the idea that progress is real, humane, and inevitable died. As early as 1932, Lewis Mumford thought progress to be "the deadest of the dead ideas ... the one notion that was thoroughly blasted by the twentieth century experience".

&nbsp;

> It is enough to say that if Diderot, Adam Smith, and Jefferson had lived through, they could not possibly have believed in the friendly flow of history.

&nbsp;

> We have been left with the idea that progress is neither natural nor embedded in the structure of history; that is to say, it is not nature's business or history. It is our business. No one believes, or perhaps ever will again, that history itself is moving inexorably toward a golden age (AP: it seem that this idea is already partly forgotten, mostly because of our ignorance). The idea that *we* must make our own future, bend history to our own will, is, of course, frightening and captures the sense of Nietzsche's ominous remark that God is dead. We have all become existentialists, which lays upon us responsibilities that once were shared by God and history.

&nbsp;

> Perhaps because of such psychic burden, we have held on to the idea  that technological innovation is *synonymous* with moral, social, and psychic progress.

&nbsp;

> Nicholas Negroponte envisions a time when we may speak to a doorknob or a toaster and predicts that, when we do, we will find the experience no more uncomfortable than talking to a telephone answering machine. He has nothing to say about how we may become different by talking to doorknob (and he has no clue about how talking to an answering machine s is far from comfortable). He is concerned only that we *adapt* to our technological future. He nowhere addresses the psychic or social meaning of adaptation. People are quite capable of adapting to all sorts of changes - soldiers adapt themselves to killing, children adapt themselves to being fatherless, women can adapt themselves to being abused. I have not doubt we can adapt ourselves to talking much more to machines than to people. But that is not an answer to anything.

&nbsp;

> Perhaps because of such psychic burden, we have held on to the idea  that technological innovation is *synonymous* with moral, social, and psychic progress.

**Questions to be asked about any new technology**

1) What is the problem to which this technology is the solution?
2) Whose problem is it?
2) What people and institutions might be most seriously harmed by a technological solution?
4) What new problems might be created because we have solved this problem?
5) What sort of people and institutions might acquire special economic and political power because of technological change?
6) What changes in language are being enforced by new technologies, and what is being gained and lost by such changes?


&nbsp;

> We do not always have to go in the direction that some technology takes us. We have responsibilities to ourselves and our institutions that supersede our responsibilities ti the potential of technology.

&nbsp;

> Technology, as Paul Goodman once remarked, is a branch of moral philosophy, not of science; which suggests that advise that comes from people who have little or no philosophical perspective is likely to be arid if not dangerous.

&nbsp;

> We need technology to live, as we need food to live. But, of course, if we eat too much food, or eat food that has no nutritional value, or eat food that is infected with disease, we turn a means of survival into its opposite. The same may be  said of our technology. Not a single philosopher would dispute that technology may be life-enhancing or life-diminishing. Common sense commands us to ask, Which is it?

&nbsp;

> Television solved several important problems, but in solving them changed the nature of political discourse, led to a serious decline in literacy, and quite possibly made the traditional process of socializing children impossible.

&nbsp;

> Was it inevitable that by 1995 American children would be watching 5,000 hours of television before entering the first grade, 19,000 hours by high school's end, and by age twenty would have seen 600,000 television commercials?

&nbsp;

> Think, for example, of how words "community" and "conversation" are now employed by those who use the Internet. I have the impression that "community" is now used to mean, simply, people with similar interests, a considerable change from an older meaning: A community is made up if people which may not have similar interests but who must negotiate and resolve their differences for the sake of social harmony...
As to "conversation", two (or more) people typing messages to each other are engaged in activity quite different from what is usually called a conversation.

&nbsp;

> To use the term "distance learning" to refer to students and teacher sending e-mail messages to each other may have some value, but it obscures the fact that the act of reading a books is the best example of distance learning possible, for reading not only triumphs over the limitations of space and co-presence bit of time as well.


&nbsp;

> I find it useful to ask of any technology that is marketed as indispensable, What problem does it solve for *me*? Will it advantages outweigh its disadvantages? Will it alter my habits and language, and if so, for better or worse? ...
I will use technology when I judge it to be in my favor to do so. I resist being used *by* it. In some cases I may have moral objections. But in most instances, my objection is practical, and reason tells me to measure the results from that point of view.

**Language**

&nbsp;

> Rather than their reading Derrida, they ought to read Diderot, or Voltaire, Rousseau, Swifts, Madison, Condorcet, or many of the writers of the Enlightenment period who believed that, for all of the difficulties in mastering language, it is possible to say what you mean, to mean what you say, and to be silent when you have nothing to say.

**Information**

&nbsp;

> Newspapers purpose, in general, was to create a cosmopolitan citizenship, informed about he best ideas and most recent knowledge of the time.
