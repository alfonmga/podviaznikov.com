### Introduction

> Imagined futures are always more about where we have been than where we are going.

&nbsp;

### A Bridge to the 18th century

> To forget our mistakes is bad. But to forget our successes may be worth.

&nbsp;

> When people do not have a satisfactory narrative to generate a sense of purpose and continuity,
a kind of psychic disorientation takes hold, followed by a frantic search for something to believe in or,
probably worse, a resigned conclusion that there is nothing to find.

&nbsp;

> I write for those who are still searching for a way to confront the future, a way that
faces reality as it is, that is connected to a humane tradition, that provides sane authority and
meaningful purpose...
Where should we look for such a way? Well, of course, one turns first to the wisdom of the sages, both near and far. Marcus Aurelius said, "At every action, no matter by whom preferred, make it a practice to ask yourself, 'What is his object in doing this?' But begin with yourself; out this question to yourself first of all." Goethe told us, "One should, each day, try to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few reasonable words." Socrates said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Rabbi Hillel said, "What is hateful to thee, do not do to another." The prophet Micah: "What does Lord require of thee but do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with The God." And our own Henry David Thoreau said, "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end."

&nbsp;

> Marvin Minsky and others working in the field of artificial intelligence have prophesied enthusiastically that humans will become merely pets of their computers

&nbsp;

> I am suspicious of people who want us to be forward-looking. I literally do not know what they mean when they say, "We must look ahead to see where we are going". What is it that they wish us to look at? There is nothing yet to see in the future. If looking ahead means anything, it must mean finding in our past useful and humane ideas with which to fill the future.

&nbsp;

> I am suspicious of people who want us to be forward-looking. I literally do not know what they mean when they say, "We must look ahead to see where we are going". What is it that they wish us to look at? There is nothing yet to see in the future. If looking ahead means anything, it must mean finding in our past useful and humane ideas with which to fill the future.

&nbsp;

> What is there (AP: XX century) to find - the principle of indeterminacy? Nietzsche's arguments for the death of God? Freud's insistence that reason is merely a servant of the genitalia? The idea that language is utterly incapable of providing accurate maps of reality?

&nbsp;

> Among their (AP: ancient greeks) values none stood higher than that in all things one should strive for excellence.

&nbsp;

> "Every culture", Lewis Mumford once wrote, "lives within its dream.". But we often lose our dream, as I believe happened to us in the twentieth century. And we are in danger if we cannot reclaim one that will help us to go forward. What else is history for if not to remind us about our better dreams?

&nbsp;

> Let us not turn to the eighteenth century in order to copy the institutions she fashioned for herself but in order that we may better understand what suits us. Let us look there for instructions rather than models. Let us adopt principles rather than details.

&nbsp;

### Progress

> Bacon is the first to claim that the principle end of scientific work was t advance the "happiness of mankind". He continually criticized his predecessors for failing to understand that the real, legitimate, and only goal of the sciences is the "endowment of human life with new inventions and riches"

&nbsp;

> Both David Hume and Adam Smith argued that there existed a self-generating impulse of rising expectations that must lead to a society of continuous improvement.

&nbsp;

> Bernard Mandeville argued that the "private vices" of envy and pride are, in fact, "public virtues" in that they stimulate industry and invention, and Hume wrote that the "pleasure of luxury and the profit of commerce roused men from their indolence", leading them to advances in their various enterprises.

&nbsp;

> "In Defense of Poetry", he (AP: Perry Shelley) made the arguments that explained why Reason itself was insufficient to produce humane progress. Indeed, when science and technology claim to provide ethical imperatives, we are lead into moral catastrophe...
It is only through love, tenderness, and beauty, he wrote, that the mind is made receptive to the moral decency, and poetry is the means by which love, tenderness, and beat are best cultivated. It is the poetic imagination, not scientific accomplishment, that is the engine of moral progress... Thus, the "heaven city" that the eighteenth-century  rationalists dreamed of is not reachable through reason alone...
Progress is the business of the heart , bit the intellect.

&nbsp;

> The idea of progress, then, is one of the great gifts of the Enlightenment. The eighteenth century invented it, elaborated it, and promoted it, and in doing so generated vast resources of vitality, confidence, and hope. But the eighteenth century also criticized and doubted it, initiating powerful arguments about its limitations and pitfalls.

&nbsp;

### Technology

> Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola, documented in their novels the spiritual emptiness that a culture obsessed with progress produces.

&nbsp;

> For all of the Twain's enthusiasm for the giantism of American industry, the totality of his work is an affirmation of the pre-technological values. Personal loyalty, regional tradition, the continuity of family life, the relevance of the tales and wisdom of the elderly, are the soul of his books.

&nbsp;

> It seemed clear to many in the nineteenth century that progress was as real as gravity or any other natural phenomenon. And its reality was given special force by the great invention of invention. We learned *how* to invent things, and the question of *why* receded in importance.The idea that if something could be done, it should be done was born in the nineteenth century. And along with it there developed a profound belief in all the principles through which invention succeeds: objectivity, efficiency, standartization, measurement, a market economy, and, of course, faith in progress.

&nbsp;

> But something had happened, as we know, in the twentieth century. Among other things the idea that progress is real, humane, and inevitable died. As early as 1932, Lewis Mumford thought progress to be "the deadest of the dead ideas ... the one notion that was thoroughly blasted by the twentieth century experience".

&nbsp;

> It is enough to say that if Diderot, Adam Smith, and Jefferson had lived through, they could not possibly have believed in the friendly flow of history.

&nbsp;

> We have been left with the idea that progress is neither natural nor embedded in the structure of history; that is to say, it is not nature's business or history. It is our business. No one believes, or perhaps ever will again, that history itself is moving inexorably toward a golden age (AP: it seem that this idea is already partly forgotten, mostly because of our ignorance). The idea that *we* must make our own future, bend history to our own will, is, of course, frightening and captures the sense of Nietzsche's ominous remark that God is dead. We have all become existentialists, which lays upon us responsibilities that once were shared by God and history.

&nbsp;

> Perhaps because of such psychic burden, we have held on to the idea  that technological innovation is *synonymous* with moral, social, and psychic progress.

&nbsp;

> Nicholas Negroponte envisions a time when we may speak to a doorknob or a toaster and predicts that, when we do, we will find the experience no more uncomfortable than talking to a telephone answering machine. He has nothing to say about how we may become different by talking to doorknob (and he has no clue about how talking to an answering machine s is far from comfortable). He is concerned only that we *adapt* to our technological future. He nowhere addresses the psychic or social meaning of adaptation. People are quite capable of adapting to all sorts of changes - soldiers adapt themselves to killing, children adapt themselves to being fatherless, women can adapt themselves to being abused. I have not doubt we can adapt ourselves to talking much more to machines than to people. But that is not an answer to anything.

&nbsp;

> Perhaps because of such psychic burden, we have held on to the idea  that technological innovation is *synonymous* with moral, social, and psychic progress.

**Questions to be asked about any new technology**

1) What is the problem to which this technology is the solution?

2) Whose problem is it?

2) What people and institutions might be most seriously harmed by a technological solution?

4) What new problems might be created because we have solved this problem?

5) What sort of people and institutions might acquire special economic and political power because of technological change?

6) What changes in language are being enforced by new technologies, and what is being gained and lost by such changes?


&nbsp;

> We do not always have to go in the direction that some technology takes us. We have responsibilities to ourselves and our institutions that supersede our responsibilities ti the potential of technology.

&nbsp;

> Technology, as Paul Goodman once remarked, is a branch of moral philosophy, not of science; which suggests that advise that comes from people who have little or no philosophical perspective is likely to be arid if not dangerous.

&nbsp;

> We need technology to live, as we need food to live. But, of course, if we eat too much food, or eat food that has no nutritional value, or eat food that is infected with disease, we turn a means of survival into its opposite. The same may be  said of our technology. Not a single philosopher would dispute that technology may be life-enhancing or life-diminishing. Common sense commands us to ask, Which is it?

&nbsp;

> Television solved several important problems, but in solving them changed the nature of political discourse, led to a serious decline in literacy, and quite possibly made the traditional process of socializing children impossible.

&nbsp;

> Was it inevitable that by 1995 American children would be watching 5,000 hours of television before entering the first grade, 19,000 hours by high school's end, and by age twenty would have seen 600,000 television commercials?

&nbsp;

> Think, for example, of how words "community" and "conversation" are now employed by those who use the Internet. I have the impression that "community" is now used to mean, simply, people with similar interests, a considerable change from an older meaning: A community is made up if people which may not have similar interests but who must negotiate and resolve their differences for the sake of social harmony...
As to "conversation", two (or more) people typing messages to each other are engaged in activity quite different from what is usually called a conversation.

&nbsp;

> To use the term "distance learning" to refer to students and teacher sending e-mail messages to each other may have some value, but it obscures the fact that the act of reading a books is the best example of distance learning possible, for reading not only triumphs over the limitations of space and co-presence bit of time as well.


&nbsp;

> I find it useful to ask of any technology that is marketed as indispensable, What problem does it solve for *me*? Will it advantages outweigh its disadvantages? Will it alter my habits and language, and if so, for better or worse? ...
I will use technology when I judge it to be in my favor to do so. I resist being used *by* it. In some cases I may have moral objections. But in most instances, my objection is practical, and reason tells me to measure the results from that point of view.

&nbsp;

### Language

> Rather than their reading Derrida, they ought to read Diderot, or Voltaire, Rousseau, Swifts, Madison, Condorcet, or many of the writers of the Enlightenment period who believed that, for all of the difficulties in mastering language, it is possible to say what you mean, to mean what you say, and to be silent when you have nothing to say.

&nbsp;

### Information

> Newspapers purpose, in general, was to create a cosmopolitan citizenship, informed about he best ideas and most recent knowledge of the time.

&nbsp;

> Information was not thought of as a commodity to be sold. It had no separate existence, as it does in our age, specifically, it was not thought to be worthwhile unless it was embedded in a context, unless it gave shape, texture, or authority to a political, social, or scientific concept, which itself was required to fit into some world-view.

&nbsp;

> One did not give information to make another "informed". One gave information to make another do something or feel something, and the doing and feeling were themselves part of a larger idea. Information was rhetorical instrument, and this idea did not greatly change until the mid-nineteenth century.

&nbsp;

> The change in the meaning of information was largely generated  by invention of telegraphy and photography in the 1840s. Telegraphy, in particular, gave legitimacy to the idea of context-free information; that is, to the idea that the value of information need not be tied to any function it might server in social and political life. It may exist by itself, as a means of satisfying curiosity and offering novelty. The telegraph made information into a commodity, a "thing" desirable in itself, separate from its possible uses and meaning. In the process, telegraphy made public discourse essentially incoherent. It brought into being a world of broken time and broken attention, to use Mumford's phrase. The principal strength of the telegraph was its capacity to move information not collect it, explain it, or analyze it.

&nbsp;

> Like telegraphy, photography re-creates the world as a series of idiosyncratic events. There is no beginning, middle, or end in a world of photographs. as there is none implied by telegraphy. The world is atomized. There is only a present, and it need not be part of any story that can be told.

&nbsp;

> "Mythinformation" is an almost religious conviction that at the root of our difficulties - social, political, ecological, psychological - it the fact that we do not have enough information. This, in spite of everyone's having access to books, newspapers, magazines, radios, television, movies, photographs, videos, CDs, billboards, telephones, junk mail, and, recently, the Internet.

&nbsp;

> If our schools are not working and democratic principles are losing their force, that has nothing to do with insufficient information.

&nbsp;

> Information consists of statements about the facts of the world. Facts cannot be wrong. They are what they are. Statements about facts - that is, information - can be wrong and often are.

&nbsp;

> The Internet is not a "truth" medium, it is an information medium.

&nbsp;

> Newspapers should get out of information business and into the knowledge business.

&nbsp;

> What do I mean by "knowledge"? I define knowledge as organized information - information that is embedded in some context; information that has a purpose, that leads one to seek further information in order to understand something about the world.

&nbsp;

> When one has knowledge, one knows how to relate information to one's life, and, especially knows when information is irrelevant.

&nbsp;

> The worst thing about television news or radio news is that there is no reason offered for why information is there; no background; no connectedness to anything else; no point of view; no sense of what the audience is supposed to do with the information.

&nbsp;

> We are presented with a world  of "and"s, not "because"s. This happened, *and* then this happened, *and* then something else happened.

&nbsp;

> I mean by wisdom the capacity to know what body of knowledge is relevant to the solution of significant problems. Knowledge is only organized information. It is self-contained, confined to a single system of information about the world. One can have a great deal of knowledge about the world but entirely lack wisdom. That is frequently the case with scientists, politicians, entrepreneurs, academics, even theologians.

&nbsp;

> Knowledge cannot judge itself. Knowledge must be judged by other knowledge, and therein lies the essence of wisdom.

&nbsp;

> Editorials merely tell us *what* to think. I am talking about telling us what we need to know in order to think. That is the difference between mere opinion and wisdom. It is also the difference between dogmatism and education. Any fool can have an opinion; to know what one needs to know to *have* an opinion is wisdom; which is another way of saying that wisdom means knowing what questions to ask about knowledge.

&nbsp;

> I rather like imagining a time when, in addition to op-ed pages, we will have "wisdom pages", filled with relevant questions about the stories that have been covered, questions directed at those who offer different bodies of knowledge from those which the stories themselves confront. I can even imagine a time when the news will be organized, not according to the standard format of local, regional, national, and world news, but according to some other organizing principle - for example, the seven deadly sins of greed, lust, envy, and so on.

&nbsp;

> We live now in a world to too much information, confusing specialized knowledge, and too little wisdom.

&nbsp;

> The problem to be solved in the twenty first century is not how to *move* information, not the engineering of information. We solved that problem long ago. The problem is how to transform information into knowledge, and how to transform knowledge into wisdom.

&nbsp;

### Narratives

> "Radical historicism" claims that there are no ultimate truths, especially moral truths: that there is no transcendent authority to which we may appeal for a final answer to a question, Is this right or wrong thing to do?

&nbsp;

> In the nineteenth century, Nietzsche put the matter in a brutal light by arguing that reason is a kind of linguistic illusion, that good and evil, are equally, illusionary, and there is nothing but one's will and power to realize one's will. In other words, there is no difference between the sentences "I want to do this" and  "I have a right to do this".

&nbsp;

> I mean by "narrative" as story. I refer to *big stories* - stories that are sufficiently profound and complex to offer explanations of the origins and future of people; stories that construct ideals, prescribe rules of conduct, specify sources of authority, and, in doing all this, provide a sense of continuity and purpose. Joseph Campbell and Rollo May, among others, called such stories "myths". Marx had such stories in mind referring to "ideologies". And Freud called them "illusions". No matter. What is important about narratives is that human being cannot live without them. We are burdened with a kind of consciousness that insists on our having a purpose.
Purposefulness requires a moral context, and moral context is what I mean by a narrative.

&nbsp;

> We think of a philosophe as a person who is involved in a political and social affair, who is eager to change how things are, who is obsessed with the enlightenment of others.

&nbsp;

There are several names of the transcendent authority:

- Natural Law

- Practical Reason

- First Principles

- Traditional Morality

&nbsp;

> Mill said: "The essence of religion is the strong and earnest direction of the emotions and desires toward the ideal object, recognized as of highest excellence, and as rightfully paramount over all selfish objects of desire".

&nbsp;

> What we may learn from these two great philosophes, Eistein and Mill, is what they learned from their predecessors - that it is necessary to live *as if* there is transcendent authority. "One can have the clearest and most complete knowledge of what *is*", Eistnein wrote, "and yet not be able to deduce from that what *should* be the *goal* of our human aspirations. Objective knowledge provides us with powerful instruments for the achievement  of certain ends, but the ultimate goal itself and longing to reach it must come from another source". The other source is religion. Neither Mill nor Einstein believed in the stories that give form and inspiration to traditional religious systems, what Mill called the "supernatural religions". But both understood that we require a story that provides a basis for moral conduct and has a transcendent character. They found it in "natural law", and in the capacities of "human nature". In their stories, human beings have innate feelings for the general good and the unity of mankind. Mill called his story the Religion of Humanity. Einstein spoke of Cosmic Religious feeling. And they found the details of their moral code in sacred texts and history, as well as custom; that is to say, in our obligations to those whom we have judged to have acted in accord with the principles if human solidarity. Mill wrote:
  "... the thought that our dead parents or friends would have approved our conduct is scarcely less powerful motive than the knowledge that our living ones do approve it; and the idea that Socrates, or Howard, or Washington, or Antonius or Christ would have sympathized with us, or that we are attempting to do our part in the spirit in which they did theirs, has operated on the very best minds as strong incentive to act up to their highest feelings and convictions"
That there os a tendency *as part of our nature* toward our being "moral" - detesting wanton killing, honoring parents, caring for children, speaking truthfully, loving mercy, overcoming egotism, and all the other exhortations we find shared by sacred texts - is a legacy of Enlightenment. And that this tendency cannot be proven in a scientific manner but must be taken on faith is also a feature of that legacy. And that there can be no objection to one's believing in a divine source for one's moral grounding is yet another feature of the legacy, provided one does not claim absolute certainty for one's belief.

&nbsp;

> As we proceed into a postmodern world, we are bereft of a narrative that can provide courage and optimism; we are facing what Václav Havel and others have called "a crisis in narrative". Old gods have fallen, either wounded or dead. New ones have been aborted. "We are looking", he said, "for the new scientific recipes, new ideologies, new control systems, new new institutions". In other words, we seeks new narratives to provide us with "an elementary sense of justice, the ability to see things as others do, a sense of transcendental responsibility, archetypal wisdom, good taste, courage, compassion, and faith".

&nbsp;

> Galileo said, "The intention of the Holy Spirit is to teach how one goes to heaven, not how heaves goes".

&nbsp;

> Pope John Paul II said, "Science can purify religion from error and superstition. Religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes".

&nbsp;

> Science and religion will be hopeful, useful, and life-giving only if we learn to read them with new humility - *as tales*, as limited human renderings of the Truth.

&nbsp;

> I believe we are living just now in a special moment in time, at one of those darkening moments when all around us is change and we cannot yet see which way to go. Our old ways of explaining ourselves  to ourselves are not large enough to accommodate a world made paradoxically small by our technologies, yet larger than we can grasp. We cannot go back to simpler times and simpler tales - tales made by clans and tribes and nations when the world was large enough for each to pursue its separate evolution. There are no island continents in the world of electronic technologies, no places left to hide or withdraw from the communities of women or men. We cannot make the world accept one tale - and tat one our own - by chanting it louder  than the rest or silencing those who are singing a different song. We must take to heart the sage remark of Niels Bohr, one of our century's greatest scientist. He said, "The opposite of a correct statement is an incorrect statement. The opposite of a profound truth is another profound truth." ... We can only make the human tale larger by making ourselves little smaller - by seeing that the vision each of us is granted is but a tiny fragment of a much greater Truth not given to mortals to know.

&nbsp;

### Children

> (AP: Rousseau made two powerful contributions to the idea of Childhood). The first was in his insistence that the child is important in himself, and not merely a means to an end...
Rousseau's second idea was that child's intellectual and emotional life is important , not because we must to know about it in order to teach and train our children, but because childhood is the stage of life when man most closely approximates the "state of nature".

&nbsp;

> Childhood was invented in the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth, it began to assume the form with which we are familiar. In the twentieth century, childhood began to unravel, and by the twenty first, may be lost altogether - unless there is some serious interest in retaining it.

&nbsp;

> There were two intellectual strains of which the idea (AP: of childhood) was composed. We might call them the Lockean, or the Protestant, conception of childhood, and the Rousseauian, or Romantic, conception. In the Protestant view, the child is an unformed person who, through literacy, education, reason, self-control and shame, may be made into a civilized adult. In the Romantic view, it is not the unformed child but the deformed adult who is the problem. The child possesses as his or her birthright capacities for candor, and understanding , curiosity, and spontaneity that are deadened by literacy, education, reason, self-control, and shame...
To Rousseau, education was essentially a subtraction process; to Locke an addition process. But whatever the differences between these to metaphors, they do have in common a concern for the future. Locke wanted education to result in a rich, varied, and copious book; Rousseau wanted education to result in a healthy flower. This is important to keep in mind, for a concern for the future is increasingly missing from the metaphors of childhood in the present day. Neither Locke not Rousseau ever doubted that childhood requires future-oriented guidance of adults.

&nbsp;

> "Information revolution" ... has made it impossible to keep secrets from the young - sexual secrets, political secrets, social secrets, historical secrets, medical secrets; that is to say, the full content of adult life, which must be kept at least partially hidden from the young if there is to be a category of life known as childhood.

&nbsp;

> Children are neither black tablets nor budding plants. They are markets; that is to say, consumers whose needs for products roughly the same as the needs of adults... The point is that childhood, if it can be said to exist at all, is now an economic category. There is very little the culture wants to do for their children except to make them into consumers.

&nbsp;

> It is not inevitable that the computer will be used to promote sequential, logical, complex, and even philosophical thought among the mass of people. There are economic and political interest that would be better served by allowing the bulk of semiliterate population to entertain itself with the magic of visual computer games, to use and be used by computers without understanding.

&nbsp;

### Democracy

> John Stuart Mill argued that the active participation of the governed in the process of government is an essential component of a democratic system. "The food of feeling", he wrote, "is action... Let a person have nothing to do for his country, and he will not care for it." That, I assume, is what John F. Kennedy meant in saying, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country". Political indifference in the death of democracy.

&nbsp;

> Tocqueville wrote:
"Here, then, is motley multitude with intellectual wants to be supplied. These new votaries of the pleasure of the mind have not all had the same education; they are not guided by the same lights, do not resemble their own fathers; and they themselves are changing every moment with changing place of residence, feelings, and fortune. So there are no traditions, or common habits, to forge links between their minds, and they have neither the power nor the wish nor the time to come to common understanding. But it is from this heterogeneous, stirring crowd that authors spring, and from it they must win profit and renown."

&nbsp;

> "In America", Tocqueville wrote, "parties do not write books to combat each other's opinions, but pamphlets, which are circulated for a day with incredible rapidity and then expire."

&nbsp;

> Democracy depends on public discourse, and therefor the kind of quality of the discourse is of singular importance. Simply to say that more information is received more quickly in diverse forms, with opportunities for fast feedback, is not to say that democratic processes are enriched.

&nbsp;

> In a culture dominated by print, public discourse tends to be characterized by a coherent, orderly arrangement of facts and ideas. The public for whom it is intended is generally competent to manage such discourse. In a print culture, writers make mistakes when they lie, contradict themselves, fail to support their generalizations, try to enforce illogical connections. In a print culture readers make mistakes when they don't notice, or even worse, don't care.

&nbsp;

> (AP: Marshall McLuhan) remarked in a letter to publisher that we must "approach the book as cultural therapy, as indispensable ingredient in communal diet, necessary for maintenance of civilized values as opposed to tribal values"

&nbsp;

Questions we should ask:

1) Does any decline in the significance of the printed word make democracy less rational? Can a representative democracy, even participatory democracy, function well if its citizens minds are not disciplined by the printed word?

2) To what extend do the new media promote egoism, and therefore undermine the sense of community without which democratic polity cannot function?

3) What sort of time-machines are the newer media - television, computers, CDs, faxes? Even more important, what transformations in consciousness do they promote? Does anyone know? Is it a matter widely discussed?

4) Do the new media if communication help or hinder in the development of shared dreams of democracy? Do our movies, TV shows, and songs bind us or loosen us?

&nbsp;

### Education

> There are three clear legacies of the eighteenth century that bear on education; that is to say, on schooling. The first ... is the idea that schooling must be based on understanding the nature of childhood and, in particular, of the different stages through which the young travel on their journey to adulthood. The second ... is the idea that an educated populace is a national resources. And the third is the assumption than an educated mind is practiced in the uses of reason, which inevitably leads to a skeptical - one might event say scientific - outlook.

&nbsp;

> "Let the child be as free as possible", he (AP: Pestalozzi) wrote, "treasure every moment which may be conductive to freedom, peace, and equanimity. Do not teach by words anything which you can teach by actual experience of things as they are."

&nbsp;

> Skepticism is the principal legacy of the Enlightenment. There is nothing more profound to do than to carry that legacy forward by making and effort at conveying it to our young.

&nbsp;

5 suggestions on education:

1) Teach children something about art and science of asking questions.

> School is traditionally considered a place for students to learn answers, not the questions which evoke answers. What will happen if a student, being given a set of facts, asks, "What is a fact? How is it different from an opinion? And who is to judge?"

2) Study The Trivium: logic, rhetoric, and grammar.

> These subjects are about the relationship between language and reality; they are about differences between kind of statements, about the nature of propaganda, about the ways in which we search for truths, and just about everything else one needs to know in order to use language in a disciplined way and to know when others aren't.

&nbsp;

> Whatever else we bring into the new century, we will certainly feature the greatest array of propagandistic techniques in the history of humankind.

&nbsp;

> These ideas - that people create meanings by the names they use, and we are free to rejects the names that are given - are central to language education, and are one's principal source of defense against a culture in which propaganda is the largest industry.

3) Teach scientific outlook.

> The science curriculum is usually focused on communicating the known facts of each discipline without serious attention ... to the history of discipline, the mistakes scientist have made, the methods they use and have used, or the ways in which scientific claims are either refuted or confirmed.

&nbsp;

> Knowledge is the quest, not a commodity; what we thing we know comes out of what we ones thought we knew; what we will know in the future may make a hash of what we now believe.

&nbsp;

> Most students have no idea why Copernicus is to be preferred over Ptolemy. If they know of Ptolemy at all, they know that he was "wrong" and Copernicus was "right", but only because their teacher or textbook says so. This way of believing is what scientists regard as dogmatic and authoritarian. It is the exact opposite of scientific belief.

4) Forth suggestion concerns "technology education".

> Everyone will know how to use computers. But what they will *not* know, as none of us did about everything from automobiles to movies to television, is what are the psychological, social, and political effects of new technologies. And that is a subject that ought to be central in schools...
If we are going to make technology education part of the curriculum, its goal must be to teach students to use technology rather than to be used by it. And that means that they must know how a technology's use affects the society in which they live, as well as their own personal lives. This is something we didn't do with television, and, I fear, we are now not doing with computer technology.

5) Final suggestion concerns religion.

> I ... propose that, beginning sometime in later elementary school and proceeding with focused detail in high school and beyond, we provide our young with opportunities to study comparative religion. Such studies would promote no particular religion but would aim at illuminating the metaphors, literature, art, and ritual of religious expression itself.


&nbsp;

> I regard history as the single most important idea for our youth to take with them into the future. I call it an idea rather than a subject because every subject has a history, and its history is an integral part of the subject. History, we might say, is meta-subject. No one can claim accurate knowledge of a subject unless one knows how such knowledge came to be. I would, of course, favor "history" courses, although I have always thought such courses out to be called "histories" so that our youth would understand that what once happened has been seen from different points of view, by different people, each with a different story to tell.
