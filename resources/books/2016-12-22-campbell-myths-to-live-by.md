## Review



## Notes

> With our old mythologically founded taboos unsettled by our own modern sciences, there is everywhere in the civilized world a rapidly rising incidence of vice and crime, mental disorders, suicides and dope addictions, shattered homes, impudent children, violence, murder, and despair. These are facts; I am not inventing them. They give point to the cries of the preachers for repentance, conversion, and return to the old religion. And they challenge, too, the modern educator with respect to his own faith and ultimate loyalty. Is the conscientious teacher - concerned for the moral character as well as for the book-learning of his students - to be loyal first to the supporting myths of our civilization or to the "factualized" truths of his science? Are the two, on every level, ad odds? Or is there not some point of wisdom beyond the conflict of illusion and truth by which lives can be put back together again?

&nbsp;

> For since it has always been on myths that the moral orders of societies have been founded, the myths canonized as religion, and since the impact of science on myths results - apparently inevitably - in moral disequilibration, we must now ask whether it is mot possible to arrive *scientifically* at such an understanding of the life - supporting nature of myths, that, in criticizing their archaic features, we do not misinterpret and disqualify their necessity - throwing out, so to say, the baby (whole generations of babies) with the bath.

&nbsp;

> Myths, according to Freud's view, are of the psychological order of dream. Myths, so to say, are public dreams; dreams are private myths. Both, in his opinion, are symptomatic of repressions of infantile incest wishes, the only essential difference between a religion and neurosis being that the former is more public. The person with a neurosis feels ashamed, alone and isolated in his illness, whereas the gods are general projections onto a universal screen. They are equally manifestations of unconscious, compulsive fears and delusions.

&nbsp;

> According to his (AP: Carl G. Jung) way of thinking, *all* the organs of our bodies - not only those of sex and aggression - have their purposes and motives, some being subject to conscious control, others, however, not. Our outward-oriented consciousness, addressed to the  demands of the day, may lose touch with inward forces; and the myths, states Jung, when correctly read, are the means to bring us back in touch. They are telling us in in picture language of powers of the psyche to be recognized and integrated in our lives, powers that have been common to the human spirit forever, and which represent the wisdom of species by which man has weathered the milleniums. Thus, they have not been and can never been displaced by the findings of science, which relate rather to the outside world than to the depth that we enter in sleep. Through a dialogue conducted with these inward forces through our dreams and through a study of myths, we can learn to know and come to terms with the greater horizon of our own deeper and wiser, inward self. And analogously, the society that cherishes and keeps its myths alive will be nourished from the soundest, richest strata of the human spirit.

&nbsp;

> The old texts confront us with horizons. They tell us that a loving, kind, and just father is out there, looking down upon us, ready to receive us, and ever with our own dear lives on his mind. According to our sciences, on the other hand, nobody knows *what* is out there, or if there is any "out there" at all.

&nbsp;

> We are living in a different time, and whatever defends us from the madhouse can be applauded as good enough - for those without nerve.

&nbsp;

> If a *differentiating* feature is to be named, separating human from animal psychology, it is surely this of the subordination in the human sphere of even economics to mythology. And if one should ask why or how any such unsubstantial impulsion ever should have become dominant in the ordering of physical life, the answer is that in this wonderful human brain of ours there has dawned a realization unknown to the other primates. It is that of the individual, conscious of himself as such, and aware that he, and all that he cares for, will one day die.

&nbsp;

> In every one of the mythological systems that in the long course of history and prehistory have been propagated in the various zones and quarters of this earth, these two fundamental realizations - of the inevitability of individual death and the endurance of the social order -  have been combined symbolically and constitute the nuclear structuring force of the rites and, thereby, the society.

&nbsp;

> Consequently, in the dual unclear unit just named, there is to be recognized, not only a factor representative of the *unity* of our species, but also one of *differentiation*. Not only does all mankind face death, but the various people of the world face death in greatly different ways.
