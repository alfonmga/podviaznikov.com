## Review

Collection of essays on different topics from education, childhood, politics, technology, television etc.
Postman, as always, provides insights into our culture (mostly American) and suggests some practical ideas how to prevent negative ongoing trends. As always he uses wisdom of sages, thinkers, writers, and philosophers from the past to help us understand current social issues.

His essays and observations draw a picture of quite sad future. A lot of this predications are already fulfilled, so Postman is unfortunately was very accurate in them which he poses as warnings for us.

However, what I liked about this book is that he tries to stay optimistic. He reminds us that civilized society is very vulnerable and we should pay attention to dangers. And he tries to provide us with a mindset how to do just that.


## Notes

> The brain does not regard brain change as a problem. If we think of language as brain of civilization, then it is possible that severe language-damage may not be perceived by the social body as a problem. It is possible that we have adapted ourselves  to disinformation, to Newspeak, to picture newspapers and magazines, to religion revealed in the form of entertainment, to politics in the form of a thirty-second television commercial. In adapting ourselves, we come to accept the present situation as the only available standard.

&nbsp;

> Unless one’s complaints are grounded in a sense of duty to one’s country or to a recognizable humane tradition, they are not worthy of serious attention.

&nbsp;

> One becomes fastidious about method only when one has not story to tell.

&nbsp;

> We do not see *anything*  as it is except through the questions we put to it.

&nbsp;

> It is meaningless to have answers if we do not know the questions that produces them… To have an answer  without knowing the questions, without understanding that you might not have been given a different answer if the question had been posed differently, may be more than meaningless; it may be exceedingly dangerous.

&nbsp;

Question-asking:

  - a vaguely formed question produces a vaguely formed answer
  - every question has a point of view embedded in it
  - for any question that is posed, there is almost always an alternative question that will generate an alternative answer
  - every action we take is an answer to a question, even if we are not aware of it
  - ineffective actions may be the result of badly formed questions
  - a question is a language, and therefor susceptible to all the errors to which an unsophisticated understanding of language can lead

&nbsp;

> The principles and rules of asking questions obviously differ as we move from of system of knowledge to another.

&nbsp;

> As language itself creates culture in its own image, each new medium of communication re-creates or modifies culture in *its* image; and it is extreme naïveté to believe that a medium of communication or, indeed, any technology is merely a tool, a way of doing. Each is also a way of *seeing*. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. TO a man with a pencil, everything looks like a sentence; to a man with a television camera, everything looks like a picture, and to a man with a computer, the whole world looks like a data.

&nbsp;

> Radio, for example, made it unnecessary for people to read to each other, or to read a all. Movies led people out of their homes; television brought them back but not to read.

&nbsp;

> "Watching television" is something quite different from "watching a television program". The later implies a selection, the former a compulsion.

&nbsp;

> In the television-commercial parables, the root cause of evil is Technological Innocence, a failure to know the particulars of the beneficent accomplishments of the industrial process.

&nbsp;

> This is where television news is at its most radical - not in the giving publicity to radical causes, but in producing the impression of an ungovernable world.

&nbsp;

> Just as it is natural for a physicist upon reaching his deepest understandings to be drawn forward religion, so it is natural for a mature philosopher to turn forward the problems of education.

&nbsp;

> Pomposity is the triumph of style over substance.

&nbsp;

> Euphemism ... is that form of balderdash wherein we attempt to obscure the nature of reality.

&nbsp;

> Television screens saturated with commercials promote the Utopian and childish idea that all problems have fast, simple, and technological solutions.

&nbsp;

> Commercial television adds to the Decalogue several impious commandments, among them that thou shalt have no other gods than consumption, thou shalt despise what is old, thou shalt seek to amuse thyself continuously, and thou shalt avoid complexity like the ten plagues that afflicted Egypt.

&nbsp;

> How can I help students to get an idea? ... One of the ways that seem to help is to ask them to survey their stock of beliefs, choose one of them that they hold deeply, and then argue that its opposite is true. The result is often liberating, and provides confirmation of the commonplace that playing with language is an important means of making discoveries.

&nbsp;

> It is odd that we have no word for serendipity's close by but troublesome cousin, especially because it is more common variety of experience. I refer to a situation in which someone looks to one thing, discovers a more valuable thing, but *doesn't know it*. I propose the word *columbusity*, if honor of Christopher Columbus.

&nbsp;

> We may ... be so preoccupied with defending ourselves against attach that we are unable to recognize when our enemy is inadvertently helping our case. That is why Napoleon warned his generals that they must never interrupt an enemy when he is in the process of committing suicide.

&nbsp;

Idea that, first, gets students to pay attention, and second, gets them to think critically:

> During this semester, I will be doing a great deal of talking. I will be giving lectures, answering questions, and conducting discussions. Since I am an imperfect scholar, and, even more certainly, a fallible human being, I will inevitably be making factual errors, drawing some unjustifiable conclusions, and perhaps passing along my opinions as facts. I should be very unhappy if you were unaware of these mistakes... Your task is to make sure that none of my errors goes by unnoticed. At the beginning of each class I will, in fact, ask you to reveal whatever errors I made in the previous session. You must, of course, say why these are errors, indicate the source of your authority, and, if possible, suggest a truer or more useful or less biased way of formulating what I said ...

&nbsp;

> A discovery is a discovery, and an idea is an idea. Its source is irrelevant.

&nbsp;

> We are, to use his (AP: Korzybski) phrase, "time-binders", while plants are "chemistry-binders", and animals are "space-binders". Chemistry-binding is the capacity to transform sunlight into organic chemical energy; space-binding, the capacity to move about and control a physical environment. Human have these capacities, too, but are unique in their ability to transport their experience through time. As time binders, we can accumulate knowledge from the past and communicate what we know to the future.

&nbsp;

> Our principle means of accomplishing binding of time is symbol. But our capacity to symbolize is dependent upon and integral to another process, which Korzybski called "abstracting". Abstracting is the continuous activity of selecting, omitting, and organizing the details of reality so that we experience the world as patterned and coherent. Korzybski shared with Heraclitus the assumption that the world is undergoing continuous change and that no two events are identical. We give stability to to our world only through our capacity to re-create it by ignoring differences and attending to similarities: although we know that we cannot step into the "same" river twice, abstracting allows us to act as if we can.

&nbsp;

> Whatever we say something *is*, it is not (AP: Korzybski)

&nbsp;

> Humans live in two worlds - the world of events and things, and the world of *words* about events and things. In considering the relationship between these two worlds, we must keep in mind that language does much more than construct concepts about the events and things in the world; it tells us what sort of concepts we ought to construct. For we do not have a name for every thing that occurs in the world. Languages differ not only in their names for things but in what things they choose to name.

&nbsp;

> (AP: Korzybski's) non-Aristotelian perspective requires that we learn and internalize the most up-to-date assumptions and understandings about the structure of the world: the word, for example, is not a thing; no two events in the world are identical; no one can say everything about an event; things are undergoing continuous change; et cetera.

&nbsp;

Korzybski's recommendations for modification of patterns of speech:

 - reduce as much as possible our uses of the verb "to be".
 - use time-markers, which he called "dating". When we use a name, for example, we should accustom ourselves to affixing a date to it so that we will remember that people and things change over time, e.g. S.I. Hayakawa<sub>1951</sub>, The Supreme Court<sub>1975</sub>...
 - employ a simple form of indexing. E.x. German<sub>1</sub> is not German<sub>2</sub>. This will assist in helping ourselves remember that things with the same name are different.

&nbsp;

> The *symbolic form* of television does not require any special instruction or learning. In America, television-viewing begins at about the age of eighteen months, and by thirty-six months children begin to understand and respond to television imagery... There is no need for any preparation or prerequisite training for watching television... Watching television requires no skills and develops no skills. That is why there is no such things as remedial television-watching. That is also why you are not better today at watching television than you were five years ago, or ten.

&nbsp;

> Television erases the dividing line between childhood and adulthood in two ways: it requires no instruction to grasp its form, and it does not segregate its audience. Therefore, it communicates the same information to everyone, simultaneously, regardless of age, sex, level of education, or previous condition of servitude.

&nbsp;

> The theme music came up and Sassoon had just time enough to say, "Don't go away. We'll be back with a marvelous new diet and then a quick look at incest".

&nbsp;

> Television if relentless in both revealing and trivializing all things private and shameful.

&nbsp;

> Childhood innocence is impossible to sustain, which is why children have disappeared from television... All the children on televisions shows are depicted as merely small adults, in the manner of thirteenths - and fourteenth-century paintings... You will see children whose language, dress, sexuality, and interests are not different from those of the adults on the same shows.

&nbsp;

> As television begins to render invisible the traditional concept of childhood, it would not be quite accurate to say that it immerses us in an adult world. Rather, it uses the material of the adult world as basis for projecting a new kind of person altogether. We might call this person the adult-child... Television promotes as desirable many of the attitudes that we associate with childishness - for example, an obsessive need for immediate gratification, a lack of concern for consequences, and almost promiscuous preoccupation with consumption.

&nbsp;

> Junk food, once suite only to the undiscriminating palates and iron stomachs of the young, is now common fare for adults. It has already been forgotten that adults are supposed to have more developed taste in food than children. McDonald's and Burger King commercials show us that this distinction is no longer relevant.

&nbsp;

> With the assistance of modern contraceptives, the sexual appetite of both adults and children can be satisfied without serious restraint and without mature understanding of its meaning. Here, television has played an enormous role, since it not only keep the entire population in a condition of high sexual excitement but stresses a kind of egalitarianism of sexual fulfillment: sex is transformed  into a product available to everyone - let us say, like mouthwash or under-arm deodorant.

&nbsp;

> The *idea* of children  implies a vision of the future. They are the living messages we send to a time we will not see. But television cannot communicate a sense of the future or, for that matter, a sense of the past. It is a present-centered medium, a speed-of-light medium. Everything we see on television is experienced as happening *now*. The grammar of television has no analogue to the past and future tenses in language. It amplifies the present out of all proportion and transforms the childish need for immediate gratification into a way of life. We end up with what Christopher Lasch calls "the culture of narcissism" - no future, no children, everyone fixed at an age somewhere twenty and thirty.

&nbsp;

> I believe that human beings need first to be  children before they can be grown-ups. Otherwise, they remain like television's adult-child all their lives, with no sense of belonging, no capacity for lasting relationships, no respect for limits, and not grasp of the future.

&nbsp;

> Television obliterates the distinction between child and adult, as it obliterates social secretes, as it undermines concepts of the future and the value of restraint and discipline, we seem destined to be moving back toward a medieval sensibility from which literacy had freed us.

&nbsp;

> "Future schlock" is the name I give to a cultural condition characterized by the rapid erosion of collective intelligence. Future schlock is the aftermath of future shock. Whereas future shock results in confused, indecisive, and psychically uprooted people, future schlock produces a massive class of mediocre people.

&nbsp;

> Men do not become tyrants in order to become warm (AP: Aristotle).

&nbsp;

> Brooks was making a kind of prophecy ... that the producers of American culture will increasingly turn our history, politics, religion, commerce, and education into forms of entertainment, and that we will become as a result a trivial people, incapable of coping with complexity, ambiguity, uncertainty, perhaps even reality. We will become, in a phrase, a people amused into stupidity.

&nbsp;

> (AP: Huxley) prophesied, if I may it this way, that there is a tyranny lurking in a Coca-Cola bottle; that we could be ruined not only by what we fear and hate but by what we welcome and love, by what we construe to be a gift from the gods.

&nbsp;

> In Orwell's book people are controlled by inflicting pain. In *Brave New World*, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure.

&nbsp;

> When a culture becomes overloaded with pictures; when logic and rhetoric lose their binding authority; when historical truth becomes irrelevant; when the spoken or written word is distrusted or makes demands on our attention that we are incapable of giving; when our politics, history, education, religion, public information, and commerce are expressed largely in visual imagery rather than words, then a culture is in serious jeopardy.

&nbsp;

> There are two ways in which the spirit of a culture becomes a prison. This was the way of Nazis, and it appears to be the way of the Russians. In the second - the Huxleyan - culture becomes a burlesque. This appears to be the way of the Americans. What Huxley teaches is that in the Age of Advanced Technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling countenance than from one whose face exudes suspicion and fate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice; we watch him, by ours. When a culture becomes distracted by trivia; when political and social life are redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments; when public conversation becomes a form of baby talk; when a people become, in short, an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then - Huxley argued - a nation finds itself at risk and culture-death is a clear possibility.

&nbsp;

> To be an Athenian is to hold knowledge and, especially, the quest for knowledge in high esteem. To contemplate, to reason, to experiment, to question - these are, to an Athenian, the most exalted activities a person can perform. To a Visigoth, the quest for knowledge is useless unless it can help you to earn money or to gain power over other people.
> To be an Athenian is to cherish language because you believe it to be humankind's most precious gift. In their use of language, Athenians strive for grace, precision, and variety. And they admire those who can achieve such skill. To a Visigoth, one word is as good as another, one sentence indistinguishable from another. A Visigoth's language aspires to nothing higher than the cliché.
> To be an Athenian is to understand that the thread which holds civilized society together is thin and vulnerable; therefore, Athenians place great value on tradition, social restraint, and continuity. To an Athenian, bad manners are acts of violence against social order. The modern Visigoth cares little about any of this. The Visigoths think of themselves as the center of the universe. Tradition exists for the own convenience, good manners are an affectation and a burden, and history is merely what is in yesterday's newspaper.
> To be an Athenian is to take a interest in public affairs and the improvement of public behavior. Indeed, the ancient Athenians had a word for people who did not. The word was *idiotes*, from which we get our word "idiot". A modern Visigoth is interested only in his own affairs and has no sense of the meaning of community.
> And, finally, to be an Athenian is to esteem the discipline, skill, and taste that are required to produce enduring art. Therefor, in approaching a work of art, Athenians prepare their imagination through learning and experience. To a Visigoth, there is no measure of artistic excellence except popularity. What catches the fancy of the multitude is good. no other standard is respected or even acknowledged by the Visigoth.
