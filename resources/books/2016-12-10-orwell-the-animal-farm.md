## Review

Comprehensive history of Russian revolution in a very short, simple book that anyone can understand. I think in this fact lies the beauty of Orwell's work. People of all ages can understand and visualize even the most complex social changes.

It seems that Orwell did describe very closely Russian revolution with fall of capitalist empire, communist revolution, Marx, collectivization, fight between Trotsky and Stalin, eventual dictatorship and full counter-revolution and come back to the similar state as it was before 1917 but with different name.

Also, it seems, that even if it account for Russian revolution, the pattern is the same for all revolutions. This book is a good reminder for us how events usually unfold and what happens at the end. And what kind of people usually end-up on top in any system regarding of the title.


## Notes

> Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.

&nbsp;

> Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on - that is, badly.

&nbsp;

> The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves.

&nbsp;

> I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon had made in taking extra labour upon himself. Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is pleasure. On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes more truly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?

&nbsp;

> Bravery is not enough. Loyalty and obedience are more important... Discipline, comrades, iron discipline! That is the watch word for today. One false step, and our enemies would be upon us. Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?

&nbsp;

> All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.

&nbsp;

> Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and hey were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.
