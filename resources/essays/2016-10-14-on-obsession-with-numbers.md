We live in a world obsessed with numbers. They are everywhere, from Google Analytics, which is installed
on [majority popular sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics#Popularity), to numbers of followers, likes, tweets etc.

Do we really need to put and rely on the numbers in all the places and situations? Let's dive deeper and discuss few examples.

While reading book on Kindle Amazon would highlight some of the most popular phrases bookmarked by other readers. I personally noticed that whenever I see such highlighted section I'd bookmark it too in the majority of cases (maybe ~80%). Only recently I realized this behavior of mine. It's quite an interesting use case and seems like a very dangerous side-effect, because my actions are mostly automatic. I might like or agree with highlighted phrase *not because it has inherit value* but *because there is social proof for it*. Whenever I encounter such section I would probably spent less time and energy thinking about it, forming my own opinion, because I would rely on conclusions of other people.
The second reason why this might be dangerous is that it gives possibility to Amazon to manipulate peoples' opinion.

All Amazon needs to do is to highlight some sections of the book. I'm not suggesting Amazon is doing it or going to do, all I'm saying that possibility is there. It's a similar, although more subtle, situation with Google that *has power* to manipulate public opinion, influence elections etc.

Let's move on to Google Analytics.

In theory it's a tool that helps site owners 1) to collect data about visitors of their web property, 2) to make sense of the data and improve content on the site. But is it really that simple?

First of all it's not only that site owner has access to the data but Google itself has such access. Putting so much data and trust into one company doesn't seems like a wise and reliable long-term solution.

Anyway, assume you've got your data. Let's say you run online blog/magazine or video hosting site. What are you going to do?
You will find the most popular content (the one that attracts more views/interactions) and then you:

1) will try to promote it more. E.x. you would put top 10 most popular articles/videos/songs on your home page at the very top

2) will try to create more of the similar content

The main problem here is that there is no direct relation between quality or value of the content and it's popularity.
Some PhD work on physics is for sure more valuable to the society then the most viral action video, pop song, funny picture etc. So what are you going to do? If you blindly rely on analytics and few base metrics then you are going to change/create your content in a way that maximizes your numbers, simply because you can't track *quality* of the content by Google Analytics and such metric doesn't exist right now in those tools.

There is high chance that metrics suggested by Google Analytics would become your master and would drive future decisions about your product. There is [great talk](http://nxhx.org/maximizing/) by [Joe Edelman](http://nxhx.org/) who explores our obsession with maximizing numbers. He gives example of YouTube. YouTube has no information on your personal goals while you interact with it. YouTube doesn't know that you want to learn playing guitar, but what YouTube knows is *the most popular* content in general related for you. So if at any point of the time you watched music video, funny video or comedy on YouTube you will have similar recommendations while you will try to focus on learning how to play a guitar.

Why do we have number of views below every YouTube video, or number of retweets and likes for each post? Why do we need to know how many people liked post on Facebook, or our photo on Instagram? If I want to watch a video why should I care how many other people watched it. Wouldn't it influence my opinion on it?  Why can't we leave it up to the user to decide if the content is worth something. People should be able to formulate their own opinions. Otherwise it's becomes a dogma when 1 billion views for pop song validates its worthiness.

The same goes for the creators. I'm not sure having all those numbers available to the creator can influence her works in the positive way. When you create something worthy it's not always possible for people to appreciate it at the moment. There are multiple examples how now-famous painters died unknown and poor. Or e.x. Huxley's [Brave New World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22044026-brave-new-world) was heavily criticized when published and was rediscovered only 30 years later. Metrics are all about current moment. They are not focused on big picture and big message, their is no notion of perspective in them.
I'd argue that works of Shakespeare, Hemingway, Mozart would be totally different if they used tools we use and cared about numbers. Because art is about expressing yourself and your ideas and not about anticipation of a public opinion.

I'll give you one more example that might be relevant. I went to [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) website recently and I didn't see number of views below each of his essays, in fact I didn't notice any Google Analytics snippet on his site. And that makes sense because a lot of his essays you can read years later.

As Neil Postman expressed in [Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) in the moderns times we are focused on the current moment which is dictated by our mediums. And out mediums are all about feeds nowadays. And feeds are about numbers. How many new items do you have today in your feed, how many unread items are there and so on. But again, those numbers are mostly focused on entertainment, not on a *value* content provides. So numbers usually promote something entertaining. It's a way to keep something in a feed.

Another problem is that those numbers becoming part of the content itself. The published book would include phrase on the cover that it's New York Times bestseller. The movie title would include credentials of the director (references to her other successes). We would know how many copies some album sold. We would remember how much money particular Hollywood movie gathered. So this information *is a part of the movie* now.

Another challenge with numbers is that they can be manipulated. You can buy views, you can make your content popular by spending money and promoting it. So if you have enough money, you can make something mediocre become very important in the context of the current culture. Why do we need to have a system that can be gamed that easily with enough resources? Why do we need to have a system that prioritizes described distribution of efforts an resources? Instead of spending time on value creation we are spending it on marketing in the bad sense of the word.

And final problem with the new mediums and our reliance on numbers is that they discriminate old content. Mozart for sure doesn't have music videos on YouTube and can't even remotely be compared to Kanye West in the context of current way of thinking.

Extreme rise of quantity of information and content in the last century led to abundance of it. We feel lost now  because there is huge amount of books, songs, movies, articles etc. The time is limited and we need to be careful while choosing what to consume next.

How this problem was solved? It was solved with the help of the top/hot lists. We have top lists for everything now: Billboard Top 100, 40 before 40, Forbes 500, top stories on Medium, trending songs on Soundcloud, most popular tweets and Twitter Moments, most liked Facebook posts.
This sounds like a noble approach - help us to navigate in all this information. But with what cost? It creates a mass culture. It makes people have similar tastes, opinions, fears, believes. It's makes us to be lazy and dependent on some external entity.


So, giving all the information above, what can we do now?
There are few simple ideas I was thinking about:

 - remove Google Analytics and other similar tools (that is how I ran this site)
 - decouple numbers from content. E.x. don't show how many views/or comments your blog has
 - maybe have browser extension that cleanups sites and removes comments, numbers of views, suggestions etc
 - explore new ways of consuming content. Maybe consumers we need more control on the content representation? Maybe browsers itself should be unbundled into simpler tools?
 - just keep in mind that not everything should be made easier. Easy things make us lazy and laziness leads to degradation
 - be mindful of your personal goals and reflect if some site/app helps you to achieve them or just distracts you
 - to cope with abundance of information and content there is simple solution - just ignore it. Opt out. This idea was hinted by [Alain de Botton](http://alaindebotton.com/) when he said that the most important things happened not yesterday or today. In fact they probably happened decades and centuries ago. Pay attention to timeless things
