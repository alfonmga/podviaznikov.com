It's been 2.5 years since I moved to San Francisco. It's the longest stretch of time I've spent in a single city outside of my home country.

Maryna is studying interaction design in Hong Kong so I'm here by myself for the first time in an adult life.

I do have more free time than usual which I'm spending it on [reading](http://podviaznikov.com/on-reading/), programming in Clojure (still enjoying it), trying, and failing so far, to learn Spanish, playing outdoor football and cycling.

The most important part is that I'm trying to reflect on my readings, experiences, and ideas. The best day for me is the one when I have a buzz of various ideas and thoughts in my head.

I'm thinking a lot nowadays about influence of technology on our lives, what the future will bring us and what changes I want to see in society. I also thinking a lot about Ukraine, it's past and future.
