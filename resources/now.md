It's been 2.5 years since I moved to San Francisco. It's the longest stretch of time I've spent in a single city outside of my home country.

Maryna is studying interaction design in Hong Kong so I'm here by myself for the first time in an adult life.

I do have more free time than usual which I'm spending on [reading](http://podviaznikov.com/on-reading/), programming in Clojure (still enjoying it), trying and failing so far to learn Spanish, doing more outdoor sports than before.

The most important part is that I'm trying to reflect on my readings, experiences, and ideas. The best day for me is when I have a buzz of various ideas and thoughts in my head.
