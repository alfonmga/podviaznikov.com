As any other man.<br /> It’s you who made me tough and emotionally inaccessible.<br /> I became tough not because of men, but because of you.<br /> You forced me to close my heart more and more with each year.<br /> You blamed masculine nature for inaccessibility. But wasn’t you the one with whom I grew up?<br /> The one I went to school with and spend my adolescence and first adult years.</p><p>You were the mother.<br /> You were the friend.<br /> Your were the partner.<br /> You were the lover.</p><p>There are no one to blame for that.<br /> Not a mystical nature of men.<br /> We didn’t grow up on trees.<br /> We were abandoned and forced to close our hearts.<br /> You numbed us.</p><p>And only deep understanding of life itself can help to revitalize me.</p><p>Woman, I know what life is. I’ll revive my heart and show you real love.<br /> Love that comes from knowing what is pain. The love that is non-judgmental and unconditional.<br /> Woman, you’ll see. Past is the fuel for the love. The one who was really hurt can’t hurt no one.</p><p>Woman, you are like Mother Nature.<br /> Loving and deep and encompassing.<br /> But you are destructive force too.<br /> You are a hurricane, you are plague, you are tsunami.<br /> You give life but you can take it too.</p><p>This is my pledge. I finally see the duality of life. I see the need for both sexes.<br /> I see the duality of each sex. I see all of that inside myself.</p></article></section><footer class="mt4 cf lh-copy measure f6"><p class="i fr"><span itemprop="locationCreated" class="i">San Francisco</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span itemprop="datePublished" class="i">2018-09-10</span></p></footer></main></body></html>
