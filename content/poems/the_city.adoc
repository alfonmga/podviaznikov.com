= The City

In the City of Anger +
I'll build City of Love, +
I'll never surrender +
And I'll build my enclave.

Among all that despair, +
Among hatred and fear +
I'll do all repairs, +
And I'll plant a new tree.

I'll nourish respect, +
I'll escape all anxiety +
And with my core intact +
I'll build new reality.

I'll grow people of peace +
From the seeds of love, +
And I'll ban all injustice +
From this godly ashram.

And that City of Anger +
is, of course, being me, +
And that City of Love +
is the one I want to be.
