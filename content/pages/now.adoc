It has been over 4 years since I moved to San Francisco. 
It's the longest stretch of time I've spent in a single city outside of my home country.

I'm here by myself for the first time in my adult life.

I do have more free time than usual which I spend thinking, reading, programming, trying find new hobbies.

The most important part is that I'm trying to reflect on my readings, experiences, and ideas. 
The best day for me is the one when I have a buzz of various ideas and thoughts in my head.

I'm thinking a lot nowadays about influence of technology on our lives, 
what the future will bring us and what changes I want to see in myself and society. 
I am also thinking a lot about Ukraine, its past and future.
