In the City of Anger

I'll build City of Love,

I'll never surrender

And I'll build my enclave.


Among all that despair,

Among hatred and fear

I'll do all repairs,

And I'll plant a new tree.


I'll nourish respect,

I'll escape all anxiety

And with my core inact

I'll built new reality.


I'll grow people of peace

From the seeds of love,

And I'll ban all injustice

From this godly ashram.


And that City of Anger

is, of course, being me,

And that City of Love

is the one I want to be.
