Havel is role model for public figure, politician and citizen. 
He is deinitely not afraid to think deeper and to express himself. 
He is not afraid of expressing not popular opinions. 
He tries to understand pluses and minuses of each system. 
E.x. he is for continious political integration, but he thinks globalization is a problem. 
He recognized the pitfalls of both Soviet regime and consumerism society that both causes normalization and standartization of people.

It was interesting for me tead his book for several reasons: to learn his story; 
to learn about his thoughts; to take a look at his diary. 
The diary of the President was an interesting read on itself. 
It contained his agenda for a lot of days and it showed him as a real simple very likable human, 
which is quite oppsite of the politicians of the day.

Havel wanted to be a role model. 
He wanted to remind his fellow citizens of better and bigger ideals, 
he wanted to inspire them to improve. 
Politicians of today mostly move in opposite direction. 
They just represent the worst parts of our society and our people. If society is corrupt, politicians are corrupt. 
If society is uneducated, politians are profane.
