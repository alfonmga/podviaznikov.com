Personal account of Spanish war by George Orwell.

Couple of insights:
 
    - Stalinist tactics used in Spain were as terrible as in USSR
    - Press is extremely important in influencing events

What was iteresting is that Orwell few times pointed out that his account is not fully objective and that reader should not believe his words without verification. 
This is great example of professionalism. 
Orwell recognizes both his subjectivity but also his duty to the public. 
Seems like not many people back then and now do this.

Also I really like that Orwell was optimistic even in the end. 
He was wounded, needed to leave country, but at the end he still believed in human nature and better future.
