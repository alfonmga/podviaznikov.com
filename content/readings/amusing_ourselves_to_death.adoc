= Amusing Ourselves to Death
Anton Podviaznikov <anton@podviaznikov.com>

Outstanding analysis of American culture of 1980s dominated by entertainment.

Makes a lot of sense to me since I witnessed myself similar changes to the culture growing up in Ukraine during 1990s and 2000s.

This book is even more actual now in the age of Internet, mobile phones, social networks, instant deliveries etc.
