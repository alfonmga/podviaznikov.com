= The Little Prince

One of the most beautiful and simple books about life, love, death; 
about being a child and being an adult; about friendship, people and happiness.

When I was in 10th grade at school, I remember literature teacher was very enthusiastic about this book. 
She was telling us about it all the time. 
I didn't find it interesting back then. 
I didn't understand the story about little prince, talking foxes, flowers and snakes. 
Form didn't appeal to me and I probably had nothing to learn from it at that time. 
This time was different. I would recommend this book to everyone. 
It's a pure beauty. Just in few pages it shows what is important in life and what is not.
